<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'><i><span class='under'>Preface to the Second Edition</span></i></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>There is one point which I wish to stress at this appropriate time. It is something
that will prove of great aid to every student of this advanced, intensely practical, time saving
method. That is the habit of regular practice.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>CHOOSE A DEFINITE PRACTICE HOUR</h3>

<p class='c008'>It has been suggested in the course, that you practice the exercises outlined night and
morning. This is my best advice on the matter. There is a definite reason for this.
The things which you do just before you sleep at night are more apt to be remembered
than those which you do at odd times during the day. That is the reason for
choosing bed time for one period of exercise.</p>

<p class='c009'>You will find that if you have given concentrated thought and attention to the bed
time work, that in all probability AUTOMATIC FINGER CONTROL will be the first
thing you think of in the morning. And this is just the time to clinch the bargain. Get
busy at once and do the exercises over again.</p>

<p class='c009'>If you follow this procedure, you will learn very rapidly, and soon, the muscles will
begin to keep time with your brain, which, after all, is the secret of the whole thing.</p>

<p class='c009'>But even supposing you cannot find it convenient to run through the exercises night
and morning.  I know that some of our students can’t very well take the time first thing
in the morning. Yet, you should definitely decide when you can most conveniently do the
work, and then do it regularly at that same hour day after day.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>FAVORING THE MIND</h3>

<p class='c008'>The mind is a most wonderful thing. One could devote years and years to its study.
Indeed, many people already have, and even yet, we know very little about it. But out
of all of the maze of study and experiment, we have discovered that the mind responds
best under certain definite circumstances.</p>

<p class='c009'>It is particularly interesting to note the little foibles of composers and writers. Some
authors only write at night. Some only when standing at their desks. Some do their best
work when out in the open.</p>

<p class='c009'>Haydn always wanted to have on his finger the ring which Frederick the Great gave
him, when he started out to write a composition.</p>

<p class='c009'>Rossini liked to write in bed. So did our dearly beloved humorist, Mark Twain.
And so it goes. Funny in one way, and yet, not funny at all. These people are merely
favoring the peculiarities of their own minds.</p>

<p class='c009'>It is hard, especially hard for some people, to take the mind off from one subject and
put it on another. Unless one is easily able to concentrate on the task at hand, the mind
is bound to wander back to the thing we were thinking of previously.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>AN AID TO CONCENTRATION</h3>

<p class='c008'>And yet, we must concentrate on these AUTOMATIC FINGER CONTROL exercises
if we are to get the best and most out of them.</p>

<p class='c009'>Experiment shows that if we plan to study at some definite time each day, the mind
gets into the habit of responding at this particular time and is more ready to work than
if we take up the practice at irregular intervals.</p>

<p class='c009'>So choose some definite practice periods—bed time, and the first thing on arising if possible,
but some definite time, at any rate. Then, once you have set aside that hour, observe
it religiously as your practice period until something comes up that changes your
whole mode of life sufficiently to warrant setting a new study hour. Never excuse yourself
for even so much as a single day. Seven days a week is the best way to master AUTOMATIC
FINGER CONTROL.</p>

<p class='c009'>If you will follow these simple suggestions and rules of instruction of this course,
your progress is going to be sure, rapid, and very gratifying.</p>

      <div class='line'>My dear Mr. Kemp:</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>It is indeed gratifying to report the remarkable
success of the Course in AUTOMATIC FINGER CONTROL. The Sixth
edition is exhausted, and I am placing a requisition for the
Seventh.</p>

<p class='c010'>There was never any question as to the unusual benefits
that each student would derive from this new, quick way of learning
his instrument. It is a fact established by tests and
experience that training the muscles to work as fast as the
brain—and training them away from the instrument so that the
pupil has only this one thing to think about—does away with
many hours of practice and develops a more perfect technique.</p>

<p class='c010'>But the thing that pleases me most, is to see the way
our students have taken hold of the work. It seems to me
typical of the Spirit of Progress. People want the very best
they can obtain in the way of instruction. They want to take
advantage of every short-cut. And that shows great wisdom.
Money can be replaced many fold. Books can be replaced. Homes
can be replaced. Every material thing can be duplicated. But
TIME, once spent is forever lost. It is the young man and
woman who takes advantage of those things which save the minutes
and hours and days who make the startling successes in the
world.</p>

<p class='c010'>So I feel that we are doing a great service to Humanity
at large, and to every lover of Music in particular in bringing
AUTOMATIC FINGER CONTROL to the fore. Indeed, I believe we
would be justified in insisting that every one of our students—beginners
or advanced—cover the work.</p>

<p class='c010'>Every student who conscientiously follows the easy
exercises outlined in this course is assured of becoming a
better Musician in shorter time, with less effort, and a real
Musician—not a mere player.</p>

<div>
  <h2 class='c005'>INTRODUCTION</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>There are fifty-nine muscles in each arm, including the hand, which the Musician is called
upon to use in his playing. If each of these are trained to the proper degree, the heaviest
part of the task is accomplished, for not only does the control thus derived perfect technic
and touch, it also helps to overcome nervousness, develops a velvety touch, becomes an
invaluable aid to sight reading, and assists the student in gaining the power to accompany
sympathetically and accurately at sight.</p>

<p class='c009'>It is not necessary to exercise each of these muscles separately. By careful study, the
method of AUTOMATIC FINGER CONTROL has been reduced to twenty-four weeks’
work. The exercises should be practiced the required number of times twice daily, preferably
upon arising in the morning, and again in the evening.</p>

<p class='c009'>Each movement must be brisk, and as complete a contraction of the muscles involved as
possible. Perform the work with one hand at a time rather than trying to use both hands
at once. Close mental attention to the movement involved will increase the benefits derived,
especially in the case of those exercises which require that you set one muscle working
in opposition to another.</p>

<p class='c009'>Do not, in your enthusiasm, practice these exercises more than directed, nor should you
do them just before your work at the instrument.</p>

<p class='c009'>This Course comprises 31 exercises. As you will see from the lessons, it is not enough
that each exercise be practiced a single week. Sometimes you will be required to work on a
single exercise for two weeks in succession and from time to time the exercises will be reviewed.</p>

<p class='c009'>The 31 exercises have been collected and placed in numerical order at the back of the
manuscript. The lessons are found in order at the front. At the bottom of each lesson page
the exercises for the week are delegated.</p>

<p class='c009'>After you have studied your lesson sheet, turn to the exercises required, for the week’s
work, study them carefully and practice faithfully.</p>

<p class='c009'>Do not, under any circumstance, run ahead of your course. To get quick results, you
must practice the exercises in the order given, devoting at least a week’s time to each
lesson.</p>

<p class='c009'>If you are just starting to learn your instrument, complete the first two lessons in
AUTOMATIC FINGER CONTROL before you take up the practice on the instrument. Then
take up the first instrumental lesson and do it in conjunction with Lesson Three of AUTOMATIC
FINGER CONTROL.</p>

<p class='c009'>Always bear in mind that the main idea of this course is not the strength of the fingers,
nor even their suppleness. The main idea is coordination between brain and muscle, training
the muscles so as to overcome the tendency of the fingers to move more slowly than the mind.
Therefore, give your entire thought and undivided attention to what you are doing as you
practice the daily exercises. If you will do this, your progress will be rapid and sure.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>LESSON 1.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>You are starting something new—something that is going to
play a BIG part in your musical success. The degree and speed
of this success depends on one thing—YOU.</p>

<p class='c009'>Take warning from the old adage—“A new broom sweeps
clean.”</p>

<p class='c009'>You must strive for moderation in all things. During
the first few weeks, you will be tempted to give too much time
to the following exercises. During the later weeks, you may
be tempted to neglect them because of the marked improvement
which you have already received. But be determined. Go
through with the entire course just as it is outlined. Do each
exercise the exact number of times each period that is called
for. And do the entire set both night and morning.</p>

<p class='c009'>It is important that you do the various movements with
considerable effort because the complete contraction of the
muscles obtained in this way tends to squeeze the blood out of
them, thus drawing a new supply of fresh, nourishing blood in
replacement. In this way, you not only strengthen the muscles
by the movement, but you also feed both them and the nerves.</p>

<p class='c009'>The fingers and wrists must bear a heavy part in the
playing of any musical instrument, therefore, we will devote
ourselves exclusively this week to strengthening these. If the
muscles tire easily and tend to stiffen up, go a little easy
the first few days, but do some work each and every day. The
improvement will be all the more noticeable, as you are evidently
unusually in need of stronger fingers.</p>

<p class='c009'>Practice Exercises 1, 2, 3, and 4 this week.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>LESSON 2.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>How are the fingers this week? Did they feel effect of
starting regular practice? Even if they did, the temporary
lameness should be gone by now. And we must continue these
same movements another week. Pluck, remember, is that spirit
in man which fails to understand despair—which keeps a man up
even when he seems to be down. Do not falter. Keep everlastingly
at it.</p>

<p class='c009'>We add, in this lesson, an exercise for the forearm.
This is the next territory of importance to be brought under
control. You will have no difficulty with this new exercise.
The movement is of especial interest to students of the Piano
and Organ, though every musician should have the muscles
involved under perfect command.</p>

<p class='c009'>One of the greatest joys in playing is the ability to read
at sight, and to play accurately and with feeling.</p>

<p class='c009'>AUTOMATIC FINGER CONTROL brings this finished ability
more quickly than any other means, for it teaches you once and
for all how to manage your fingers. The correct action soon
becomes <span class='under'>automatic</span>, indeed, and then your full attention can be
given to the beautiful hidden meanings of the piece you are
playing. That is the highest meaning of technic—to be able to
play without any thought of the mechanical “how.”</p>

<p class='c009'>If you are studying these lessons in conjunction with an
instrument, it will be well, for the first few weeks to give
more attention to the Finger Control exercises than to practicing
on the instrument itself.</p>

<p class='c009'>In this way, when finally you do begin to play, your advancement
will be rapid and satisfactory.</p>

<p class='c009'>For this week, practice Exercises 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>LESSON 3.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>You should be coming along in good shape, now, so you are
to have two new exercises this week. One of them is particularly
for the hand. It is barely possible that this exercise of
snapping the fingers open will cause the wrists to tire. Do
not be discouraged by this. That is a sure indication that you
are in particular need of strengthening of these muscles, and
once they are built up, you will find yourself doing constantly
better work on the instrument.</p>

<p class='c009'>The second of the new movements is for strengthening the
upper arm. Remember to take it easy at first until the
shoulder feels strong enough to resist the strain that is brought
to bear upon it.  This valuable exercise will be continued
next week.</p>

<p class='c009'>Many students find it convenient to learn the exercises
for the week by heart, and then practice them at odd moments as
on their way to work. This is quite satisfactory, and if you
are pressed for time, it is a good idea to get into this habit.
BUT, be sure that you get in your two full periods each day.</p>

<p class='c009'>Review work in any study is of utmost importance. After
an exercise has been dropped from the current week’s lesson,
make it a point to do it, just the same, at least once or twice
a day. In this way, not only will you be assured of losing
nothing of the work that has gone before, but you will also
progress faster with the new. All of the muscles depend more
or less on each other, and what helps one, helps all.</p>

<p class='c009'>And remember—decision of character outstrips even talent
and genius in the race for success.</p>

<p class='c009'>Exercises 5, 6, 7, and 8 this week.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>LESSON 4.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Are you in tune?</p>

<p class='c009'>The finest Stradivarius is only a sounding board and four
strings—unless it is in tune. And then, it becomes a messenger
of the soul, indeed.</p>

<p class='c009'>So is it with each one of us. If we are in tune with the
Infinite, the sky is blue vaulted above us; the birds cleave
the sky with sweetest of music; there’s a song in the heart,
and a smile on the lips.</p>

<p class='c009'>How can we hope to interpret the secrets of the Master-workers
in Music unless we ourselves are in tune? Take stock
of yourself each day and see if you are really <span class='under'>living</span>.</p>

<p class='c009'>The new exercise this week is for strengthening the
fingers as well as for limbering up stiff joints. Around each
of the finger joints, there are transverse ligaments—bands of
muscle which hold the lengthwise finger muscles in place and
bind them to the bones.</p>

<p class='c009'>Unless one is using his fingers in a special and unordinary
way, these ligaments become stiff and inflexible, so that the
movement of the fingers is greatly hindered.</p>

<p class='c009'>It is absolutely essential that these muscles should be
limbered up and kept soft and pliable if you are to get any
satisfactory movement of the fingers at your instrument.</p>

<p class='c009'>Do not overlook any of these exercises, new or old.  Each
is designed to accomplish a certain definite object. Each must
be practiced a certain, definite number of times to get the
best results.</p>

<p class='c009'>This week, do Exercises 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>Lesson 5.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Test out your ideals.</p>

<p class='c009'>What is it you have in mind to accomplish? Unless you
have the way plainly charted before you, unless you are guided by
the ever glowing light of a great ideal, you are almost certain
to be dashed upon the rocks of failure.</p>

<p class='c009'>We graduate from the School of Life only with the coming
of Death. To some of us, Death comes early; to others, long
years are granted for delving into the ever changing mystery of
being. But withal, what we accomplish, is dependent on the ideal
that guided and urged on our step.</p>

<p class='c009'>Genius is infinite painstaking.</p>

<p class='c009'>It is the determination bravely to learn the truth about
ourselves and our fellow men. With a fixed determination and
a fixed ideal, YOU are of genius calibre!</p>

<p class='c009'>A month ago you set out to learn to play by the Short-Cut
Method. This method holds unquestionable advantages which
are available in no other way. It saves weeks of weary practice
at the instrument because it enables you to work to the very best
advantage when you DO play. It develops accuracy, speed and
sympathetic understanding.</p>

<p class='c009'>Here, then, is one ideal—the determination to learn to
play, so that you can give joy to others, and so that you can
take greater pleasure in self expression through the art of
Music. The degree of your success will be measured only by the
sincerity of your purpose.  It’s up to you!</p>

<p class='c009'>As Charles Dana Gibson, the famous artist says—</p>

<p class='c009'>“There isn’t any trouble with the world, today. The
trouble, if any, is with the people in it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Exercises 7, 8, 9, 11, and 12.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>LESSON 6.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>You must take particular care with the wrist exercises in
this week’s lesson. Study the cuts until you are thoroughly
acquainted with what is required, and then put considerable
“steam” behind the movements.</p>

<p class='c009'>The exercise for both hands together will call into play
certain of the finger muscles and strengthen them to the necessary
degree for playing. They will also help to free the
transverse ligaments and thus relieve the fingers of stiffness.</p>

<p class='c009'>In this exercise, as in every other, a feeling of fatigue
or pain denotes a weak condition of the muscles. It means
proceed with caution. It does NOT mean to drop the exercise.
If the fingers get tired during the first few days of a new
exercise, you may use less muscular resistance for a while, and
in extreme cases, you may be excused from going through the
movements the full number of times.</p>

<p class='c009'>But always remember, too, that tired muscles are a promise
of exceptional reward. If your need is great—if the muscles
are particularly weak to start with—the benefits you derive from
the proper strengthening and control of them will be positively
amazing.</p>

<p class='c009'>Elbert Hubbard said “Responsibilities gravitate to the
person who can shoulder them; power flows to the man who knows
how.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Conditions are unusually good for the rapid advancement of
the man who has the will to conquer—and knowledge of the weapon
in his hands. YOU have both, so I am expecting big things of
you. You would not disappoint me, would you?</p>

<p class='c009'>This week’s work is Exercises 9, 11, 13, and 14.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>LESSON 7.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Do you ever stop to think how truly marvelous is the Music
of Nature? The babbling brook, the murmuring trees, the singing
birds, the ocean’s roar, the peal of thunder, the crash of
storm, the lowing cow, the rustling grass;—all Nature sings.
But how often we hear and failing to understand, miss much of
the joy of life.</p>

<p class='c009'>It is only as we understand Nature, and our Brother, and
Ourself, that we begin to understand God. With that understanding
we begin in reality to live and to acquire.</p>

<p class='c009'>“He who comprehends the <span class='under'>nature</span> of prayer” it has been said
“bends not the knee. He towers in majesty. He goes forth to
meet his own. He ascends the mount and speaks with God.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Or, as Emerson put it, “The things that are really for
thee gravitate to thee.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The world is full of good things that are intended
especially for you. But, if you want the best, you must be
ready—through understanding, to receive the best.</p>

<p class='c009'>You should be applying the benefits of the AUTOMATIC
FINGER CONTROL Method to actual daily playing, now. Are you
doing so?</p>

<p class='c009'>Just to learn a thing and then stick it away in the closet
of your mind is a poor investment of time, effort, and money.
Put what you know into service, no matter what the subject may
be. It is <span class='under'>action</span> that begets success and commands reward!
Without action, the law of “two plus two equals four” would be an
empty farce.</p>

<p class='c009'>DO! And do the best you know.</p>

<p class='c009'>Practice Exercises 11, 13, 15, and 16.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>LESSON 8.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Irresolution is a worse vice than rashness.</p>

<p class='c009'>He who shoots worst may sometimes hit the mark, but he,
who shoots not at all can never hit it. Irresolution loosens all
the joints of a state; like an ague, it shakes not this nor that
limb, but all the body is at once in a fit. The irresolute man
is lifted from one place to another, so hatcheth nothing, but
addles all his actions.</p>

<p class='c009'>It will pay you to think carefully on the above quotation
from Feltham.</p>

<p class='c009'>Also, consider the following beautiful paragraph on
Faith.</p>

<p class='c009'>Faith is like the primitive granite of old New England.
Dig down deep and you come to it below all superimposed strata.
Go to the summit of the highest mountains and you find it, on
loftiest elevations. Faith begins as the basis of the infants
knowledge; it ends in leading us to know the bigness, the
grandeur of life.</p>

<p class='c009'>On these two things, to large degree, depends your rapid
success in learning to play through the Method of AUTOMATIC
FINGER CONTROL. You must be filled with the faith and knowledge
that each exercise has its particular place not only in strengthening
the muscles, but in preparing you for the work to come.
And knowing this, you must be filled with resolution to work and
achieve that you never falter by the way—that you never miss a
practice period.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Exercises this week are 10, 13, 15, and 16.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>LESSON 9.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Do you make it a point to keep physically fit?</p>

<p class='c009'>We are learning that Music has a great deal to do with
health, and surely health has much to do with your ability to
produce Music.</p>

<p class='c009'>Music is being used more and more in the hospitals for
quieting and cheering the patients. Music played an important
part behind the lines in the great war in the way of lending
support and courage to those so sorely in need of it.</p>

<p class='c009'>What, on the other hand, has health to do with Music?</p>

<p class='c009'>Music is self expression. If that self which produces
the melody be ill, the fact will be reflected in the playing.
Music displays the hurts of the body and the hurts of the heart,
as well. So it behooves us who would be musicians to keep well
in mind and body.</p>

<p class='c009'>To a great extent, this is just a question of common sense.
Be thoughtful of your eating, your sleeping, and your exercise,
and let Nature care for the rest.</p>

<p class='c009'>But when misfortune of any kind does overtake you—and we
are all caught at sometime or other—turn freely to your Music
for relief. You will find it. Pour out your soul in the melody
of your instrument.  If there is bitter in the heart, let it
come out. Get rid of it. If there is sadness, express it and
replace it then with joy. If there is doubt, play on until at
length comes peace again, and sweet assurance. Music brings
health—and health lends joy to Music!</p>

<p class='c009'>Practice Exercises 12, 17, 18, and 19 faithfully.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>LESSON 10.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>It is necessary to train the muscles to act quickly,
accurately, strongly, and without easy tiring if you are to be
a super-musician. In order to acquire the independent, individual
movement of the fingers, they have to go through the
“awkward squad” stage, it is true; but with the proper, thoughtful
drilling, which these lessons, like an understanding
officer gives, they soon become familiar with the commands and
learn to obey orders.</p>

<p class='c009'>Obedience is of absolute importance in learning AUTOMATIC
FINGER CONTROL.  First obedience that you must give to the
written word of the lesson. And then obedience that you must
demand of the muscles involved. When you want your finger or
whatever it may be to perform a certain movement, do not accept
anything short of perfection from it. Analyze each movement
that seems to give trouble. Trouble—understand—is half
removed.</p>

<p class='c009'>If you demand perfect obedience from your fingers each and
every time, it will not take long for you to establish that
very desirable connection—or shall we say understanding—between
the brain and the fingers which will free you from the
usual drudgery of fumbling for the notes at the instrument, of
only half comprehending what you are playing, and of getting
tired when you should still be fresh and enjoying yourself.</p>

<p class='c009'>Thus, the habit of correctness is established. If there
be any <span class='under'>good</span> habits; surely, this is one of the best that a
Musician could acquire. I commend it to you highly. It well
repays your effort in gaining it.</p>

<p class='c009'>Exercises 17, 18, 19, and 20.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>LESSON 11.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Sometimes, as we go along in a course of lessons, we are
inclined to lose sight of the original purpose. It often is
well to look back and see what we set out to do, and what we are
accomplishing.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the first place, we started out to develop strength,
flexibility, freedom of movement, independent action, and
perfect control of each one of the fingers. Our purpose in
doing these things is to enable one to save time in learning to
play any musical instrument through specializing on the finger
work which constitutes some nine-tenths of the battle. At the
same time, other benefits are expected—greater self-reliance,
greater accuracy in sight reading, and greater ease in accompanying.</p>

<p class='c009'>In order to accomplish these ends, we have been freeing
the joints from stiffness and lameness. We have been training
the fingers to move more widely and more freely. And we have
been developing the muscles, so that the fingers have been
developed, strengthened, given greater speed and facility of
action, and their endurance increased.</p>

<p class='c009'>With greater strength, has come greater independence in
action. By this time, you ought to be well started toward
perfect control of each of the fingers.</p>

<p class='c009'>Since the whole course is based on careful, scientific
investigation, the work has been built up in difficulty as the
lessons went on, so that there has been nothing really hard
about them. They are interesting and progressive. That is as
it should be. As the course proceeds, whether you have new or
review work, bear in mind that what is given is exactly what
you need, and what will help you most.</p>

<p class='c009'>Practice Exercises 17, 18, 20, and 21.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>LESSON 12.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Great thought precedes all greatness. No man is great
whose thought is not great.</p>

<p class='c009'>A pessimist and an optimist were discussing life from
different angles. “I really believe,” said the former, “that I
could make a better world myself.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Sure!” returned the optimist; “That’s just what we’re
here for. Now let’s get together and do it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>If you will get the right thought, and then get to work,
you will accomplish your part in making a better world yourself.
One of the things that the world looks to you to do is to
supply it with music—to bring harmony to quiet its tired and
jangled nerves—to bring joyous melody to liven the grief bound
heart—and to bring an atmosphere of rest to the sick and weary.</p>

<p class='c009'>With this lesson, you are completing the first half of the
work on AUTOMATIC FINGER CONTROL. You have already had most
of the movements that are necessary for the efficient playing
of your favorite instrument. It still remains to make the habit
of proper fingering second nature. So, although you will find
the old exercises coming up from time to time in the remainder
of the course, do not slight them. Indeed, your muscles should
be so much stronger now, that you can afford to run through
the exercises three times a day instead of only twice. Suppose
from now on you get in a short practice period at noon, as well
as night and morning.</p>

<p class='c009'>Yes! It will be worth while. Think BIG thoughts about
this, as well as about the rest of your daily tasks.</p>

<p class='c009'>This week, work on Exercises 17, 18, 21, and 22.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>LESSON 13.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>FRIENDS!</p>

<p class='c009'>Much has been said about friends—many beautiful things,
many apt phrases rich with understanding. To me, a friend is
one who understands me—and loves me in spite of that fact.</p>

<p class='c009'>One of my dearest friends is my piano, and I feel that
every musician must consider his instrument in this light just
as I do.</p>

<p class='c009'>When I am tired and discouraged, or when I am joyful and
full of hopeful expectation, it makes no difference what the mood,
my piano responds to my every touch. It sings with me when I
would sing. In minor chord it grieves to see me sad. It can be
light and airy when I will; or if thought runs madly on and on,
lightly touching the heights of exaltation or delving into mirey
depths beneath—still I am not alone. And being not alone, I
stand.</p>

<p class='c009'>I want you to learn to think of your instrument as a
Friend, for I know the endless joy that such a close communion
is bound to give.</p>

<p class='c009'>Would you have a friend? Then be one.</p>

<p class='c009'>It applies with equal force as regards your instrument.
You must understand it just as thoroughly as you long to have
it understand you. That is where AUTOMATIC FINGER CONTROL
should be a constant help to you. It enables you to understand
your instrument so much better.</p>

<p class='c009'>The exercises take on a simpler mien, now. That is only
possible, however, because of the good work you have already
done. Keep it up!</p>

<p class='c009'>Starting Review. Practice Exercises 1, 22, 23, and 24.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>LESSON 14.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Let me call your attention to the new exercise.</p>

<p class='c009'>Its particular purpose is the strengthening of certain of
the finger muscles which will be used quite often in playing,
the limbering up of the fingers, and the stretching of the
muscular covering of the palms. This exercise is not a difficult
movement, by any means, but if you do it with considerable
muscular resistance by the opposing sets, you will bring a large
number of muscles into play at one effort.</p>

<p class='c009'>The mind is a wonderful, yet peculiar thing.  Some of the
fads of great men typically exemplify this. For example, it
is said that Gluck could only compose in the open air. When
the spirit of composition took hold of him, he dragged his piano
out on the lawn, and there evolved his beautiful harmonies.
And yet, to me, do you know, that is not so peculiar after all.
Gluck, I take it, wanted to get close to Nature.</p>

<p class='c009'>All of us feel the urge to draw nigh to Nature.  That is
one of the reasons we so dearly love Music. Music is the
portrayal of Nature at her best.</p>

<p class='c009'>Another tale they tell is that Chateaubriand dictated his
works in his bare feet. Elegantly attired down to the extremities,
he padded softly up and down the floor, his thin, white
feet and ankles very conspicuous on the dark rugs.</p>

<p class='c009'>We all have peculiarities of living. And Musicians
generally have similar peculiarities of playing. Do you know
what yours are? Better take stock and see!</p>

<p class='c009'>Practice this week Exercises 2, 23, 25, and 31.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>LESSON 15.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>If you use considerable muscular resistance in practicing
the new exercise of this week’s lesson, you will find that the
muscles used will tire quite readily. This, remember, is proof
that this particular work is badly needed. As the days pass,
however, and these muscles are strengthened to the required
degree, you will find yourself able to perform it a greater
number of times and with perfect ease. As in every other walk
of life, you don’t get anything worth while without effort; but
as with the other exercises of this course, results come surely
and speedily.</p>

<p class='c009'>Elbert Hubbard has said “Improve your opportunities,
that’s the thing! Decide on what you want to do and what you want
to be and go after it! You’ll win, and those fellows who chase the
pee-wee, manipulate the pasteboards, and inhale cigarette
smoke, will be coming to you for advice, to borrow money, and
for passes to the poor house.”</p>

<p class='c009'>You notice he said “improve” your opportunities. He
didn’t use that old phrase about “grasping” them. And I
believe this was intentional on his part. Opportunity doesn’t
come to us so much as is commonly said. Opportunity is ever
with us.  Opportunity is just what we make it. If we have the
imagination to see the golden chances before us and to <span class='under'>improve</span>
them, we’ll make good.</p>

<p class='c009'>You are enjoying an unusual opportunity in the Musical
world in that you are permitted to learn to play your instrument
the quick and easy way. Are you improving your opportunity?</p>

<p class='c009'>Exercises 5, 25, 26, and 27.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>LESSON 16.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>In learning to lift weights, athletes start with a very
light load, and by steadily increasing it a little at a time,
they are eventually able to develop tremendous strength.</p>

<p class='c009'>You remember that old story about the farmer’s boy who,
just a few years ago, made a practice of picking up a calf and
carrying it across the barn yard. Of course, as the calf grew
and became heavier, the farmer boy’s strength increased. It
had to, otherwise he couldn’t have continued to carry the calf
around. And so it went, month after month, year after year.
And now, so they say, the farmer boy is able to throw the bull.</p>

<p class='c009'>It’s a terrible story, but we’ll overlook that fact if only
it impresses upon you one point I wish to make.</p>

<p class='c009'>The new exercise in this week’s lesson is based on the same
principle as the weight-lifting methods. You will see that
you apply auxiliary pressure for the finger muscles to work
against. By using greater and greater pressure, you can develop
almost any amount of finger strength that you may desire. So
you should stick to the careful use of this exercise for many
weeks to come.</p>

<p class='c009'>Speaking of doing an exercise week after week, I sincerely
trust that you are not neglecting your review work. You are
studying these lessons for what you get out of them. If you
really want to get your money’s worth, you must keep going over
the lessons time and again. And each time, I can promise you,
you will find new benefits and pleasures.</p>

<p class='c009'>Devote your time this week to Exercises 3, 6, 27, and 28.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>LESSON 17.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>ENERGY!</p>

<p class='c009'>Energy is that mysterious something that has the power to
do work—to get results.</p>

<p class='c009'>We can’t see energy, we can’t smell or taste it, we can’t
hear it, nor is it anything we can feel. <span class='under'>But its results</span>—we
perceive them everywhere.</p>

<p class='c009'>The heat in our homes and bodies is the result of energy.
The light that guides us by night and that brightens our daytime
is the result of energy. The electricity that turns motors and
carries our messages is another name for that indescribable
something—energy.</p>

<p class='c009'>But one of the greatest sources of energy is the human
mind. Each one of us has within himself tremendous possibilities.
We can work with our hands, or we can work with our heads.
The choice rests largely with ourselves. And the difference
between a hundred thousand dollar a year man and a ditch digger
is from the ears up. Can one indiscriminately convert himself
between these extremes? I don’t know. It is claimed, however,
that the average person uses only one-tenth of his inherent
mental ability. And I am satisfied that the curse of the age
is mental laziness.  How far the ditch digger can rise, I
believe depends wholly on how great an effort and sacrifice he
is willing to make for his advancement.</p>

<p class='c009'>Every properly guided effort for advancement does, eventually
bear fruit.  Move right up front in the forerank of
Musicians! You can, for your effort is properly guided.</p>

<p class='c009'>Exercises 4, 7, 27, and 28 comprise this week’s work.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>LESSON 18.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>It is true that these are days of specialization, but one
must be careful not to miss anything through too narrow a field
of endeavor.</p>

<p class='c009'>Take Music, for instance. You have taken the AUTOMATIC
FINGER CONTROL Method to enable you to learn to play some instrument
in quicker time than would otherwise have been expected.
AUTOMATIC FINGER CONTROL is a specialized course.</p>

<p class='c009'>Sometimes, musicians forget that there is another
instrument or branch of Music save their own. That is where
they make a mistake. Every Musician should fit himself to
teach. I don’t say that he should teach afterward, but he
should understand his instrument so well that he is perfectly
capable of teaching it.  Indeed, I doubt if one truly knows a
thing himself until he is able to teach it to others!</p>

<p class='c009'>Many of our students make a business of teaching.
Whether you are going to teach, or not, you should consider
taking up some of the other courses in Music which run right
along parallel with what you are doing. The Unit Lesson System
for Voice Perfection is something that every Musician should
have. It is a very novel method whereby it is possible to get
specific benefits from each individual lesson. It is a complete
Vocal Course, and also teaches Speech Making, Gesture, Overcoming
Nervousness and Stage-Fright, How to develop a winning
Personality, etc. Another course that you could take to
advantage is the one in sight reading. It would be a constant
help. Write for full particulars about enrolling for these.</p>

<p class='c009'>Exercises 8, 14, 25, and 26.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>LESSON 19.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>If, as has been said, the purpose of words is to conceal
thought, then it may be equally as well said that the purpose
of Music is to reveal soul.</p>

<p class='c009'>I don’t suppose that there is a human being alive but that
longs to be “understood.” There are all too few in this world
who are willing to give the time and thought and heart to the
understanding of others.  And even if there were a greater
willingness to understand, too few of us are able to express our
deepest thoughts in words.</p>

<p class='c009'>But Music is the Universal Language. Once we learn it,
the tips of our hearts creep out through the tips of our fingers.
There may be no one to hear. Perhaps no one would understand
even if they were about. But the blessed, joyous part of it
all is that at last we have found self expression, and that is
the next best thing to being understood.</p>

<p class='c009'>Remember that the composers of the ages have been talking
through this language of soul in all that they have written.
As you play a piece of music, you therefore have two tasks to
perform. You must strive to pass on the message that the Masters
left, and you must interweave with it your own inner self. That
is what is meant by interpretation and expression.</p>

<p class='c009'>You should study to be a good listener as well as a good
player, if you are to be a real Musician. Hear all of the
beautiful music that you can, whether it be on your instrument
or on some other. Music is bigger than any specific means for
expressing it, and with you, <span class='under'>Music</span> should be the first consideration.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Exercises this week are 9, 14, 23, and 31.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>LESSON 20.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>I sometimes tremble when I realise how slight is the
difference between success and failure. Success is the child of
Audacity. Failure is the offspring of discouragement.</p>

<p class='c009'>There was a great inventor, once—great not because of
his worldly possessions, but because he dreamed the most
beautiful visions of helping humanity to bigger and better
things. He had worked long and arduously on one of his ideas
hampered by lack of funds, lack of friends, and (I am sorry to
say) lack of food.</p>

<p class='c009'>All the night through he had toiled over his model.
There was just one little part needed to give the necessary
movement, but the proper thought eluded him.</p>

<p class='c009'>The cold gray dawn of another toilsome day found him
discouraged and alone on a damp, park bench. He was thoroughly
hopeless and ready to give up his idea and his ideal. True,
the successful culmination of this experiment would mean fewer
accidents in a great industry, and fewer lives sacrificed to
unnecessary carelessness. But why struggle longer? The world
called him visionary and an impractical dreamer. Why fight?</p>

<p class='c009'>Indeed, the fight had clean gone out of him. Death,
breakfast, or the lock-up were equally welcome to him. He was
through!</p>

<p class='c009'>And then, the <span class='under'>little</span> thing happened.  The doorway across
the street was opened. Through it came a piping childish voice
in joyous morning song. Little feet pattered down the steps and
soon the lisping notes came from directly at his side, while
a trusting little hand slipped confidently into his. And at
that minute the problem was solved—somebody trusted him,
somebody cared!</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>LESSON 21.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Half the giant’s strength is in the conviction that he is a
giant. The strength of a muscle is enhanced a hundred-fold
by the will power. The same muscle, when removed from the
giant’s arm—when divorced from the force of the mighty
will—can sustain but a fraction of the weight it did a moment
before it was disconnected.</p>

<p class='c009'>If you have been studying these lessons aright, you have
not only developed strong muscles, but you have also developed
an understanding of the tremendous power you wield over them.</p>

<p class='c009'>When your brain wills that the finger move quickly and
with precision, it should be enough. Without thought, effort,
your will should be carried out. There should be no faltering
about this movement because the demand was definite, and the
muscles have been trained in obedience.</p>

<p class='c009'>Whenever you are called upon to play, always bear in mind
your complete mastery over your fingers. You have nothing to
worry about. You can depend on your tools. Give your attention
to the soul meaning of the composition you are playing; or, if
you are doing accompaniment work, make a conscious effort to
efface yourself and make the soloist stand out, the predominant
influence.</p>

<p class='c009'>In passing from the silent exercises to the instrument,
you must be careful still to maintain the correct muscular
movements.</p>

<p class='c009'>Practice Exercises 13, 21, 24, and 30.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>LESSON 22.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Candidly, there is lots of room at the top in the world or
music, just as in any other line of endeavor. On the other
hand, there is a clammering, cluttering turmoil down at the
bottom. Your own position is like that of a sensible tourist in
the Alps who hires a competent guide and provides himself with
the necessary trappings for safe climbing.</p>

<p class='c009'>There is no law to prevent this traveler inviting the
guide to sit down with him at the hotel in the valley and play
pinochle. True, he pays pretty heavily for the unused equipment
and for the companionship. Besides that, he never does see the
glories of the heights. But that is his privilege.</p>

<p class='c009'>What are you doing with your musical equipment and the
helpful guidance which has been yours? Are you enjoying yourself
in the companionship of the valley, or are you daring the
paths of the mountain?</p>

<p class='c009'>I can but urge you to struggle upward. You are not
beating a new path. The way is so plainly outlined before you
you need only actively aspire and soon the reward must be yours.</p>

<p class='c009'>Specifically, what is there in store for the master
Musician?</p>

<p class='c009'>There is the profession of teaching. That ability is
something that no one can ever take from you once you acquire
it. There is professional playing in Church, Concert, and
Orchestra. Later on, you may wish to take our easy course in
Harmony and Composition, so that you can also write and arrange
music. It is thoroughly worth while. Particulars on request.</p>

<p class='c009'>This week, take Exercises 15, 20, 29, and 31.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>LESSON 23.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Suppose you do make mistakes sometimes. Is that anything
to be discouraged about? Not at all. If only you learn by
your mistakes and do not repeat the same one too often, you are
well on the road to improvement. The only person who never
makes an error is the person who never does anything. Steer
clear of such a person.</p>

<p class='c009'>But you who have practiced the Method of AUTOMATIC
FINGER CONTROL faithfully have less to worry about as regards
making mistakes than the average student. Your fingers are
especially trained to go the right place at the right time
without any conscious effort on your part. If you have not yet
achieved this degree of skill, the thing to do is—not complain—but
devote a little more time to strengthening up the
still recalcitrant muscles.</p>

<p class='c009'>Above all, keep moving. Don’t get stagnant.</p>

<p class='c009'>Idleness never won distinction in the world, and never
will. The world does not owe us a living, but each one of us
does owe the world honest, sincere work in whatever field we may
choose for our endeavors. God made man for employment and we
cannot dodge the issue.</p>

<p class='c009'>That means that everything we do must be done effectively.
When we are earning our daily bread, we must give our best.
When we are playing, we must play honestly. When we are studying,
we must strive earnestly. Only as we do this can we
enjoy life’s bounties to the full and win the progress we desire
and deserve.</p>

<p class='c009'>Exercises 10, 17, 19, and 26 for this week’s study.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>LESSON 24.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>With this lesson you end your first reading of the Method
of AUTOMATIC FINGER CONTROL. I trust that none of you will
consider the work finished, however, because you have only done
the primary work. With the greater strength of muscle and the
broader understanding of the Method itself, you are now in a
position to reap even more astounding benefits than you have
already experienced.</p>

<p class='c009'>There is no extra charge for this privilege. All that
you are required to do is to start at the beginning again and go
through the entire course as before. You will be surprised
how many things you missed the first time over.</p>

<p class='c009'>The brain develops in direct proportion to the studying
you do. And your understanding and appreciation increases to
just the same extent that your brain develops, so it stands to
reason that you are in a better position to benefit by this
course today than you were six months ago.</p>

<p class='c009'>What you have already got out of AUTOMATIC FINGER CONTROL
depends on what you have put into it. It is like putting
money in a bank and taking it out with interest. You put your
time in with the specific knowledge that years of study have
made available to you in easily absorbed form, and you take out
a distinct saving in time and effort in learning to play your
favorite instrument.</p>

<p class='c009'>I believe that your success has already fully justified
your every effort. In parting, let me assure you that you
will always find that this formula works.</p>

<p class='c009'>Effort in a worthy cause brings RESULTS.</p>

<p class='c009'>Exercises 12, 16, 18, and 28 complete this Course.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>EXERCISE 1.</h2>
</div>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/ex01.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>Hold your right hand before you, double up your
fist tightly, thumb on the outside of the fingers.
The hand turned with the palm side facing you.
Open the hand briskly and with considerable effort,
letting it turn around, so that the back of the hand
is now turned toward you. Be sure to get this point
and turn the hand around as you open the fingers.
As you open the hand, be sure to keep the fingers
stiff and bend them back from the wrist as far as
possible. Repeat this exercise twenty times.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>EXERCISE 2.</h2>
</div>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/ex02.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>Lift your elbows nearly as high as your
shoulders. Lay your left hand, palm up, straight
across your chest, so that there is a straight line
from the elbows to the finger tips. The fingers of
the right hand with the palm turned down are laid on
the fingers of the left. Twist the hands and
forearms in opposite directions, until the hands
come again into a similar position, but with the palm
of the right hand up. Reverse the action briskly.
Go through the cycle twelve times.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>EXERCISE 3.</h2>
</div>

<div  class='figcenter id003'>
<img src='images/ex03.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>Open the left hand out flat with the fingers
loosely apart.</p>

<p class='c009'>Grasp the little finger with the thumb and
fingers of the right hand. Very gently bend
it backward, as far as it will go without straining.
You must be careful not to overdo this at first.
Now bend it forward to the palm; back again and to
the right and left.</p>

<p class='c009'>Do this six times, allowing the little finger to
move freely.</p>

<p class='c009'>Now repeat the exercise, only instead of
allowing the little finger to move freely, try to
hold it rigid and immovable. Of course the muscles
of the little finger will be unable to stand the
greater strength of your right hand, and it is intended
that the finger should move, but in each case it
should move against the resistance of the finger
muscles. Repeat this exercise against resistance
fourteen times.</p>

<p class='c009'>Go through this entire process with each of the
other fingers and the thumb of the left hand. Then
take up the exercise with each of the fingers of the
right hand, moving them with your left.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>EXERCISE 4.</h2>
</div>

<div  class='figcenter id003'>
<img src='images/ex04.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>Lay the left hand flat palm down on a table,
book, or other smooth surface. Open the thumb out of
the way of the fingers.</p>

<p class='c009'>Grasp the index finger of the left hand with
the thumb and finger of the right hand. Allowing
the finger to move freely, draw it along the surface
as far as possible without straining the muscles.
Do this five times. Now with the finger muscles
resist the movement, and repeat the exercise five
times more.</p>

<p class='c009'>Allowing the finger to move freely once more,
lift it from the table in a large semi-circle,
and swing it over towards the thumb and down to the
table again. Repeat five times.</p>

<p class='c009'>Go through this same movement five times with
muscle resistance.</p>

<p class='c009'>Carry out these exercises on the other fingers
of the left hand, and then on all of the fingers of
the right hand.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>EXERCISE 5.</h2>
</div>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/ex05.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>Put your right hand and arm down at your side,
fingers extended. Keeping the elbow and upper
arm close to the body, bend the arm briskly at the
elbow, still keeping the hand open, and in a straight
line with the forearm. Repeat this exercise
twelve times with the palm of the hand turned toward
the shoulder, and twelve times with the palm of the
hand turned away from the shoulder.</p>

<p class='c009'>Now raise the upper arm, so that the elbow bends
slightly upward from the shoulder. Repeat the
same bending action of the elbow twenty times.
The position of the hand is immaterial in this exercise.</p>

<p class='c009'>Go through these motions with the left arm.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>EXERCISE 6.</h2>
</div>

<div  class='figcenter id003'>
<img src='images/ex06.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>Hold your left hand up in front of you with the
palm facing you. Press the index finger and the
middle finger tightly together. Bring the two
still held tightly together down to the palm, and
then back straight again, quickly, briskly and with
muscular resistance. The motion should be from
the knuckle joint. Naturally the other fingers will
have a tendency to curl. It makes no difference if
they do. Repeat this exercise twenty times.</p>

<p class='c009'>Next practice this exercise using the middle
and the ring fingers pressed together, letting the
little finger and the index finger remain as straight
as possible.</p>

<p class='c009'>Do the same exercise with the little finger
and the ring finger together.</p>

<p class='c009'>These same motions should be gone through with
the right hand.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>EXERCISE 7.</h2>
</div>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/ex07.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>Bring the finger tips of the right hand together
with the tip of the thumb, spreading the fingers at
the middle knuckle and rounding the whole back of
the hand. From this position snap the whole hand out
flat, with the fingers spread wide apart. Do this
forcibly. Quickly return to the original position
and repeat the exercise twelve times.</p>

<p class='c009'>This same exercise is to be performed with
the right hand.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>EXERCISE 8.</h2>
</div>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/ex08.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>Raise your left arm so that the elbow is
sticking out in front of you almost as high as the
shoulder. Bend the arm at the elbow, so that the
forearm reaches straight up in the air. Close your
hand loosely. With a rotating movement of the upper
arm, bring your fist down as low as it will go, still
keeping the elbow at the same spot. Return to the
original position. Repeat this exercise twelve
times. At first it will be advisable to do this
rather slowly and without too great effort, because
of considerable strain in the region of the shoulder
blade. Later, as the muscles become stronger and
more supple, you can increase the speed and the
intensity of the effort.</p>

<p class='c009'>Repeat the same exercise with the right arm.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>EXERCISE 9.</h2>
</div>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/ex09.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>Stand straight with the arms down at your side.
Double up your right fist. Keeping the arms
straight, swing it back as far as possible and then
front until it is directly overhead. Just the
same as you do when you swing your arm in walking,
only more so. Continue swinging the arm this way,
but instead of swinging it back at your side, move it
around, so that your arm finally swings up across
the chest to the overhead position. The idea is to
swing it, changing the plane gradually so that you
pass through all the different positions between the
side plane and the chest plane.</p>

<p class='c009'>Repeat the same motions with the left arm.</p>

<p class='c009'>Standing straight in military position as
above, raise your right arm straight out from the
shoulder, fist closed. Without bending the elbow,
swing the arm back and forth as far as possible, on a
level with the shoulders. Raise the arm a little
and continue this swinging movement, each time
raising it a little higher, then gradually descend
passing from the shoulder level and continuing down.</p>

<p class='c009'>Perform the same exercise with the right arm.</p>

<p class='c009'>Caution:—These exercises must not be done too
strenuously at first, as there is a severe strain
on the shoulder blades. After the muscles become
a little hardened, you can carry out these exercises
with more vigor and about ten times in each of the
varying positions.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>EXERCISE 10.</h2>
</div>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/ex10.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>Open out the left hand before you, with the
fingers close together. Hold the thumb apart. Move
the first finger as far toward the thumb and away
from the other fingers as possible, and back again.
Do this gently and easily five times.</p>

<p class='c009'>Now let the muscles of the hand and fingers
become tense, so that as you draw the finger over
towards the thumb with one set of muscles, the
opposing set resists the motion. Repeat this ten
times.</p>

<p class='c009'>Go through this same movement with each of the
other fingers of the left hand and then with each
of the fingers of the right hand.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>EXERCISE 11.</h2>
</div>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/ex11.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>Hold out your right hand, the palm facing you.
Separate the little finger slightly from the rest.
With a brisk, sharp movement, twist the hand at the
wrist to the left, so that the little finger moves
down as low as possible. Repeat this exercise twelve
times.</p>

<p class='c009'>Perform the same exercise twelve times with
the left hand.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>EXERCISE 12.</h2>
</div>

<div  class='figcenter id003'>
<img src='images/ex12.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>Open the left hand, thumb and fingers, all close
together, turning the hand so that the thumb is
towards your body and the little finger away from it.
Bend the first finger at the knuckle joint, and
nowhere else, and bring it down toward the palm of
the hand until it is horizontal, that is at right
angles to the plane of the palm and the other fingers.
If it will not come down of itself, help it a little
with the other hand, but be careful not to strain
the left hand muscles when you are first starting this
exercise. Try not to move the other fingers of
the left hand while you are bending the index finger
downward. Repeat this motion ten times.</p>

<p class='c009'>Go through this exercise with each of the
other fingers in turn.</p>

<p class='c009'>The first day you do this exercise, do it without
any muscular resistance to the motion. Afterwards,
from day to day, add more and more resistance as the
fingers become stronger.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>EXERCISE 13.</h2>
</div>

<div  class='figcenter id003'>
<img src='images/ex13.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>Hold the right hand edgewise before you, the
thumb towards the chest. Have the fingers closed
tightly together and bring the thumb firmly against
the first finger. With a sharp, quick action, open
the thumb away from the finger, so that it points over
your shoulder; at the same time bending the entire
hand sideways at the wrist, bringing the thumb still
nearer the shoulder. The movement must be quite
snappy to get the desired effect. Repeat twelve times.</p>

<p class='c009'>Perform this exercise twelve times with the
left hand.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>EXERCISE 14.</h2>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/ex14.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>Extend both hands in front of you, palms
together; the fingers of each hand held tightly against
those of the other; the thumbs separated from the
fingers and pointed toward you.</p>

<p class='c009'>Raise the elbows from the body, then slowly
and with muscle resistance, move the palms apart.
Leave the fingers together from base to tip. Just
as slowly and with muscle resistance, close the palms
again. Repeat this exercise five times.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>EXERCISE 15.</h2>
</div>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/ex15.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>Hold your left arm across the chest palm up, but
with the wrist bent as far down as possible, the
fingers easily curled. Place the right arm in a
similar position, but with the palm down, having
the wrist of the right hand bent upward and fingers
similarly curled. Lay the finger tips of the right
hand on those of the left. From this position twist
the forearms in opposite directions until the finger
tips again come together, this time the palm of the
right hand bent up, and of the left bent down.</p>

<p class='c009'>Reverse the motion and repeat the exercise
twelve times.</p>

<div class='chapter'>

</div>

<p class='c006'>Extend the left hand and close the fingers down
to the palm, keeping the knuckle joints straight
and bending only the two outer joints.</p>

<p class='c009'>Holding the other fingers motionless, straighten
out the index finger. You must be careful
throughout the entire exercise, never to move the
knuckle joint. Repeat five times without muscular
resistance, then go through the exercise with the
muscles tense, so that one set resists the motion of
the other.</p>

<p class='c009'>Practice this exercise on each of the remaining
fingers on the left hand and on all of the fingers
of the right.</p>

<div class='chapter'>

</div>

<p class='c006'>Stand erect, shoulders back, and without
bending forward, lean far over to the right from the
waist line. As you do this, let the right hand bend
toward the left knee. While in this position,
make a short but strong thrust, entirely from the
right shoulder which will bring the fingers of the
right hand possibly an inch nearer the left knee.
Straighten up, bend to the left and thrust out the left
shoulder. Repeat this exercise first with the right
and then with the left twelve times.</p>

<div class='chapter'>

<p class='c006'>Hold the right hand before you, the fingers
relaxed, and slightly curved, palm facing you.
Grasp the second, third and little fingers gently
with your left hand, and bend the forefinger down to
the palm from the second joint. Use considerable
pressure each time you bring the finger down to the
palm and repeat the exercise eight times, allowing
the finger to become fully relaxed between each motion.</p>

<p class='c009'>Repeat this exercise for the middle finger ten
times.</p>

<p class='c009'>For the ring finger, do this exercise twelve
times.</p>

<p class='c009'>For the little finger, do this exercise ten
times.</p>

but the thumb out of the way. Move the index finger
so that the tip of it circles around down toward the
palm, over to the thumb, to the back, and returns to
the original position. Keep the fingers straight
all of the time. Repeat this without muscular
resistance five times.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>POST SCRIPT</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>You have something more today than you had six
months ago before you took up AUTOMATIC FINGER CONTROL. You
have a nest egg. And yet, it is something more valuable,
even, than a nest egg in its ordinary sense of capital. You
have a specific knowledge and ability and dexterity that can
never be taken from you. If you have carried out the exercises
of this course in accordance with the instructions, you
are already far on the way toward the supreme mastery of your
instrument.</p>

<p class='c009'>We are always glad to hear of this progress from our
students. Write us and let us know of the marvelous results
attained in your own case.</p>

<p class='c009'>But capital, to yield returns, must be put to work.
And so must your new-found art. You have strengthened and
trained your fingers to greater skill than that enjoyed by the
average musician. You should take advantage of that fact.</p>

<p class='c009'>Fundamentally, there is a strong similarity between
all of the instruments. They all require the use of the same
finger muscles. They all make use of notes.</p>

<p class='c009'>Herein lies a wonderful opportunity for you to make
music more and more valuable and profitable to you as the
years go by. You are now ready to take up further musical
study. We strongly recommend that each student learn to play
not only one instrument, but several. It is not hard with the
start you already have. We make very attractive offers to our
students who take up the study of a second instrument. If you
are in doubt as to what instrument to study next, write us.
And sooner or later, you should also study Harmony, Composition
and Voice.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
